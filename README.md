# Introduction

This is a practice Todo application project built with Svelte and .Net Core

## Run the frontend and backend simultaneously from the root directory

Provided that your 2 folders (frontend and backend) are contained in the same parent directory, use the following commands to run both repositories at the same time.

```properties
# Enter the parent directory that contains both repositories
1. cd basic-todo // adjust folder name if necessary

# Make the script executable
2. chmod +x start.sh

# Run the script to start both projects
3. ./start.sh
```
